    This is a general lab where the actual experiment is provided nearly
    entirely by the connected arduino. By using the arduinoview library it is
    possible to "host" a website/dashboard on an embedded device, which is then
    displayed in the browser by using the WebSerial-API.

      ## Sharing Hardware

      You have loaded this lab and your are in teacher mode.
      In order to share the hardware with your students, you need to open a stationConfig:
      
      
      1. goto Settings > Station > and click on the URL below

      2. or replace the classroom in this url with station

      
      Note, the station has to be opened on a Chrome or a Chrome based browser, as it requires the WebSerial-API.
      
      
      ---
      
      
      Then attach an arduino to it that runs arduinoview:
      
      
      https://github.com/edrys-labs/module-arduinoview


      and select the appropriate baudrate before connecting.

      If your station is not connected then try to connect, the experiments in
      this lab require a baudRate of 9600.


      ... or if you new to this station an cannot see anything, simply click on
      reload to trigger a "reload" for the entire scene...

      ## Station configuration

      Make sure that this station runs in Chrome or a Chrome based browser, as it requires the WebSerial-API.

      Connect an arduino that runs arduinoview to this station and select the appropriate baudrate before connecting.

      Thats is it. The experiment should be displayed in the station and all connected students should be able to see it as well.
